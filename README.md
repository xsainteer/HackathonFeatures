# 🚀 Hackathon Features

These prototypes were developed during the [KNU Hackathon](https://www.knu.kg/ky/ru/archives/16336) as proof-of-concept solutions to real-world public sector challenges. The goal was to showcase how modern AI and software tools can automate inefficient processes and improve user experience.

## 🧠 Implemented Concepts

### 1. 🚌 Bus Face Recognizer  
Many passengers bypass bus fares using fake QR check screenshots. This solution proposes installing cameras inside public buses to recognize passenger faces and automatically trigger fare payment. It eliminates the fake check loophole entirely — though it requires abandoning QR codes in favor of biometric verification.

### 2. 🏫 School Form Recognizer  
Teachers often manually transfer grades from physical gradebooks to digital systems. This feature streamlines that process: it scans photos of paper journals, extracts grades using OCR/AI, and updates the system automatically. Can be expanded to other document digitization scenarios.

### 3. 🕵️ Fraud Detection System  
An experimental tool for identifying suspicious financial transactions using pattern recognition. While it requires a custom training dataset to be truly effective, the current prototype lays the groundwork for future development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Azure AI Services** – Face API, Document Intelligence  
- **ASP.NET Core** – Web API backend  
- **Vue.js** – Frontend interface  
- **WinForms** – Quick internal testing interfaces  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is an MVP — a rapid prototype created during a hackathon to demonstrate feasibility.  
Some parts of the code may break Clean Architecture principles due to tight deadlines and rapid iteration.
