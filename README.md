# Hackathon Features

These features were made during this hackathon - https://www.knu.kg/ky/ru/archives/16336. 

## Features

1. Bus Face Recognizer. There are many citizens that show fake checks to bus drivers, thus use public transport for free. My solution was to install cameras in all buses, that would identify faces of passengers and automatically make payments for them, which would totally erase the fake check loophole making it almost impossible to cheat bus drivers. Requires to completely leave the QR paying method though.

2. School Form Recognizer. I heard teachers complaining about having to transfer grades from physical to internet form. My idea is to make an app that would take a teacher's input data (grade book's photo), parse it and update the grade book with given result. Can be used in other areas as well.

3. Fraud Detection. Checks all the transactions and mark suspicious ones (Needs its own training data set though).


## What was used

1. Azure AI Services: Document Intelligence + Face API
2. Vue js
3. ASP.Net Core - Web API
4. WinForms

## P.S.

It's just a MVP, made to show ideas and how one can implement them
